# Better FetLife

The Better FetLife user script enhaces various features of [FetLife.com](https://fetlife.com/) pages. Current features include:

* Makes FetLife user profile pages exportable to your favorite contact management application, such as Mac OS X's native Address Book, Google Contacts, or Yahoo! Contacts.
* Makes FetLife event pages exportable to your favorite calendaring application such as iCal, Google Calendar, or Yahoo! Calendar in one click.

To enable these export features, install the [Operator Add-On for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/operator/) or the [Microformats Extension for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/microformats-for-google-c/oalbifknmclbnmjlljdemhjjlkmppjjl).
